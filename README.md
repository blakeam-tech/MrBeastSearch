## About The Project

BeastSearch uses RAG and semantic similarity to search Mr. Beast's content using text queries.

For example, if the user wanted a video of "Chandler taking his hand off a car," they would just search that and the app would return a video of Chandler taking his hand off a car.

We've indexed all of Mr. Beast's content using a RAG library called [TrufflePig](https://www.trufflepig.ai/) to perform fast, accurate searches.
